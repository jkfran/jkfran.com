I recently developed **QdrantSync**, a CLI tool to simplify and streamline migrating collections and data points between [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/) instances. It was born out of my experience with Qdrant snapshots, which can be tedious and complex—especially when moving data to clusters with different configurations or sizes.  

### Why QdrantSync?  
Snapshots are powerful, but they’re not always the best option for every scenario. Challenges arise when migrating data:  
- **Cluster Size Differences**: Snapshots assume identical setups, making it tricky to adjust for varying cluster configurations.  
- **Flexibility**: Adapting data, schema, or replication factors during migration requires extra effort.  
- **Incremental Updates**: Snapshots don't support partial or staged migrations easily.  

QdrantSync solves these pain points by providing a robust and flexible alternative for seamless data transfer.  

### Key Features:  
- **Customizable Migration**: Fine-tune schema settings like replication factors and prefixes to suit your destination cluster.  
- **Incremental Migration**: Mark and track migrated data, allowing you to resume or refresh migrations without duplication.  
- **Scalable Batch Processing**: Scroll through large datasets efficiently with real-time progress tracking via `tqdm`.  
- **Error Handling**: Safe operations ensure no unintended overwrites or data loss, with options to continue migrations for existing collections.  

### Getting Started:  
1. **Install**:
   ```bash  
   pip install QdrantSync  
   qdrantsync --help  
   ```  
2. **Migrate Data**:
   ```bash  
   qdrantsync --source-url <source> --destination-url <destination> --migration-id <id>  
   ```  

### Use Cases:  
- Migrate Qdrant data between environments (e.g., staging to production).  
- Upgrade infrastructure or move to a different cloud provider.  
- Perform selective or incremental backups.  

### Contribute:  
I’d love to hear your feedback or see contributions! The project is open-source and MIT-licensed.
