    <p>I have always been interested in the computer and technology scene. Since I was a child, I have been learning by the self-taught way, so when I had the chance to continue my studies, I chose computer science. Currently, I spend my days working as a web developer at Canonical. I have experience in many different areas of web development, from backend programming to DevOps engineering.</p>
